Data contributions generally progress through three phases:
Phase I, data entry. The preparation of data for ingestion into the database, using standardized templates. If the data pass basic quality checks performed by the ISCN Coordinator and the database curator, they are ingested into an access-restricted portion of the database. Essential criteria for ingestion are summarized below:
1) Dataset Quality- In order to be ingested, a dataset must not duplicate data already in the database and must clearly attribute its provenance, including contributor/curator, methodology, citation and acknowledgment information.
2) Measurement Quality- A dataset must have observations with unique names, relevant measurements with reasonable values, units, and coordinates of the sampled locations.
Phase II, validation. Upon ingestion into the database, data enter Phase II. This stage allows the ISCN database team, the data contributor and her/his authorized collaborators to validate and explore that contributor’s data, and alert database managers to quality concerns. General database users are unable to see Phase II data. Phase II is intended to allow data contributors sufficient time to analyze their data and submit results for independent publication, but Phase II data should transition in a reasonable timeframe into Phase III. A maximum timeframe for Phase II is yet to be established by the ISCN Scientific Steering Group. Conversely, contributors may wish to submit their data, validate it, and transition it to Phase III as soon as possible, without any additional holding time for publication.
In all cases, no Phase II data will be transitioned to Phase III before the ISCN Coordinator has communicated with the data contributor about such a transition.
Phase III, data release. Phase III data will be used to populate a database accessible to ISCN members via a link from the ISCN website (http://www.soilcarb.net). Summary information about the Phase III data (e.g., number of contributors, geographic distribution of data) may be released to public-accessible portions of the ISCN website in order to encourage the recruitment and participation of new members. Data contributors are encouraged to remain accessible to correspondence from the database team and database users to answer questions and provide data updates or revisions, or to nominate a curator who can share this long-term responsibility.
Responsibilities pertaining to data contribution and management:
  • It is the responsibility of the data contributor to ensure that her/his dataset is reasonably accurate at the time of submission
  • It is the responsibility of the data contributor to identify sites that are location sensitive.
  • It is the responsibility of database managers to earmark such sites, generalize their coordinates to 0.1 degree, and identify the data contributor in possession of the detailed coordinates.
  • It is the responsibility of data contributors to identify the data phase at the time of submission, and in the event of any data status changes (e.g., after the contributor has analyzed her/his data and the results have been accepted for publication)
  • It is the responsibility of database managers to release data according to data phase assignments.
