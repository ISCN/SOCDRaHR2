abstract = {The boreal region stores a large proportion of the world's terrestrial carbon (C) and is subject to high-intensity, stand-replacing wildfires that release C and nitrogen (N) stored in biomass and soils through combustion. While severity and extent of fires drives overall emissions, methods for accurately estimating fire severity are poorly tested in this unique region where organic soil combustion is responsible for a large proportion of total emissions. We tested a method using adventitious roots on black spruce trees (Picea mariana) in combination with canopy allometry to reconstruct prefire organic soil layers and canopy biomass in boreal black spruce forests of Alaska (USA), thus providing a basis for more accurately quantifying fire severity levels. We calibrated this adventitious-root-height method in unburned spruce stands and then tested it by comparing our biomass and soils estimates reconstructed in burned stands with actual prefire stand measurements. We applied this approach to 38 black spruce stands burned in 2004 in Alaska, where we measured organic soil and stand characteristics and estimated the amount of soil and canopy biomass, as well as C and N pools, consumed by fire. These high-intensity quantitative estimates of severity were significantly correlated to a semiquantitative visual rapid assessment tool, the composite burn index (CBI). This index has proved useful for assessing fire severity in forests in the western United States but has not yet been widely tested in the boreal forest. From our study, we conclude that using postfire measurements of adventitious roots on black spruce trees in combination with soils and tree data can be used to reconstruct prefire organic soil depths and biomass pools, providing accurate estimates of fire severity and emissions. Furthermore, using our quantitative reconstruction we show that CBI is a reasonably good predictor of biomass and soil C loss at these sites, and it shows promise for rapidly estimating fire severity across a wide range of boreal black spruce forest types, especially where the use of high-intensity measurements may be limited by cost and time.},

abstract = {Soil organic C (SOC) levels were determined to a depth of 100 cm for the nine units designated on a 1957 1:20000 soil map of Barrow, AK prepared by J.V. Drew. The legend was updated by converting Drew's map units into the recently adopted Gelisol order in U.S. soil taxonomy and field verified. The SOC varied from 2.5 kg m−3 in modern beach sediments to >73 kg m−3 in Typic Sapristels in high-centered, ice-wedge polygons developed in reworked organic-rich lake sediments. The SOC averaged 50 kg m−3 for the entire 64-km2 area (excluding open water). Considerable variability in SOC exists within individual soil map units. For example, SOC levels in a Typic Aquiturbel (formerly classified as a Meadow Tundra, Normal Phase soil) ranged from 24 to 109 kg m−3 Substantial variation in SOC occurs within individual patterned-ground units. For a high-centered, ice-wedge polygon with a diameter of 15 m, SOC levels are 24, 32, and 64 kg m−3 for the wedge trough, rim, and center, respectively. In a low-centered, ice-wedge polygon, SOC levels are 28 and 83 kg m−3 for the trough and center. The variation in SOC within soil map units and individual patterned-ground units is due primarily to differences in the amount of ground ice. Active-layer thickness varies within and between soil map units, ranging from 31 cm in Typic Sapristels to >100 cm in modern beach sediments. About 47\% of the SOC in the upper meter of soil was in the active layer at the time of sampling; the remainder occurring in frozen ground, much of it meeting the definition of permafrost. Some of the SOC originates from past reworking of organic-rich lake sediments. Carbon stocks in near-surface permafrost may be of global significance and should be inventoried in other tundra regions.},

abstract = {The distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) was determined in 60 pedons from northern Alaska by horizon, within the seasonal thaw layer, and to a depth of 1 m. Concentration of SOC, bulk density, and SOC density were remarkably uniform for a given genetic horizon and had low standard errors. With increasing degree of decomposition, the bulk density increased, the concentration of SOC decreased, and the soil horizon C density increased in organic horizons. For mineral horizons, gleying is accompanied by an increase in C density, which is due to the effect of saturation on limiting decomposition of organic matter. Cryoturbation of organic or mineral minerals into the subsoil results in an increase in C density primarily from an increase in bulk density because of compaction from the overlying layers and more closely packed soil particles from frost churning. Estimated SOC storage for individual horizons and for the seasonal thaw layer were highly correlated (p < 0.01) with measured values from an independent data set for the same region published by other investigators. Equations relating C density to percentage of visible ice enable prediction of SOC in the near-surface permafrost. The equations generated by this study will be useful in preparing a detailed soil C map of the arctic regions.},

abstract = {We examined soils in 20 drained thaw-lake basins (DTLBs) near Barrow representing four age classes: young [0–50 years before present (BP)], medium (50–300 BP), old (300–2000 BP), and ancient (2000–5500 BP). In addition, we examined an erosional remnant that is about 8000 yr in age with deep organic deposits. There are significant age-related differences in thickness of the organic layer, which for DTLBs represents surface organic accumulation since lake drainage. The lower portion of the organic layer progresses in decomposition stage from fibric in young basins to sapric in ancient basins and the erosional remnant. Whereas extractable organic matter (humic- and fulvic-acid fractions) in the organic layer decreases, the nonextractable portion (humin) increases with basin age. There are significant age-related differences (p = 0.027) in soil organic carbon (SOC) of the organic layer; however, there were no significant differences in C pools for other depths or within the upper 100 cm. Profile SOC pools in DTLBs average 48 kg m−3, which is less than elsewhere on the Arctic Coastal Plain (62 kg m−3). From a depth of 100 to approximately 160 cm, SOC pools average 3.2 kg C m−2 dm−1, confirming that there are large amounts of SOC below the traditional reporting depth of 100 cm. The spatial variability of SOC pools increases with relative basin age class and is likely because of increased variability in hydrology related to enrichment of ground ice in the upper permafrost. The long-term net accumulation (during the last 5500 yr) of SOC is 13 g m−2 yr−1},

 abstract = {In the three-component conceptual model of arctic soils, the transition zone is recognized as a layer intermediate between the seasonally thawed active layer above and the stable permafrost below. Although typically frozen and therefore part of the near-surface permafrost, the transition zone episodically thaws over a time period ranging from sub-decadal to multicentennial. From an analysis of 138 pedons from the Arctic Coastal Plain near Barrow, Alaska, we were able to delineate the upper boundary of the transition zone in 78% and the lower boundary in 70% of the pedons. The transition zone exhibits the effects of cryoturbation, contains abundant redistributed organic carbon, is enriched by ice in the forms of lenses, veins, and nets (reticulate vein ice) and has abundant soil moisture. The surface (upper boundary) of the transition zone is found at an average depth of 34 ± 7 cm below the ground surface and has an average thickness of 23 ± 8 cm. We observed no significant differences in the thickness of the transition zone or the depth of its boundaries in drained thaw-lake basins ranging in age from 300 to 5500 years BP, suggesting that the processes leading to the development of this zone occur rapidly in Arctic Alaska. Recognition of the transition zone has implications for understanding pedogenic processes in permafrost-affected soils and for determining the response of near-surface permafrost to climate warming.},

abstract = {The influence of discontinuous permafrost on ground-fuel storage, combustion losses, and postfire soil climates was examined after a wildfire near Delta Junction, AK in July 1999. At this site, we sampled soils from a four-way site comparison of burning (burned and unburned) and permafrost (permafrost and nonpermafrost). Soil organic layers (which comprise ground-fuel storage) were thicker in permafrost than nonpermafrost soils both in burned and unburned sites. While we expected fire severity to be greater in the drier site (without permafrost), combustion losses were not significantly different between the two burned sites. Overall, permafrost and burning had significant effects on physical soil variables. Most notably, unburned permafrost sites with the thickest organic mats consistently had the coldest temperatures and wettest mineral soil, while soils in the burned nonpermafrost sites were warmer and drier than the other soils. For every centimeter of organic mat thickness, temperature at 5cm depth was about 0.5??C cooler during summer months. We propose that organic soil layers determine to a large extent the physical and thermal setting for variations in vegetation, decomposition, and carbon balance across these landscapes. In particular, the deep organic layers maintain the legacies of thermal and nutrient cycling governed by fire and revegetation. We further propose that the thermal influence of deep organic soil layers may be an underlying mechanism responsible for large regional patterns of burning and regrowth, detected in fractal analyses of burn frequency and area. Thus, fractal geometry can potentially be used to analyze changes in state of these fire prone systems. ?? 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Using the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) we calculate cumulative distributions of active layer thickness (ALT) under current and future climates. The difference in cumulative ALT distributions over time was multiplied by C and N contents of soil horizons in Gelisol suborders to calculate newly thawed C and N. Thawing ranged from 147 PgC with 10 PgN by 2050 (representative concentration pathway RCP scenario 4.5) to 436 PgC with 29 PgN by 2100 (RCP 8.5). Organic horizons that thaw are vulnerable to combustion, and all horizon types are vulnerable to shifts in hydrology and decomposition. The rates and extent of such losses are unknown and can be further constrained by linking field and modelling approaches. These changes have the potential for strong additional loading to our atmosphere, water resources, and ecosystems.},

  title = "Geologic controls of soil carbon cycling and microbial dynamics in temperate conifer forests",
  abstract = "Understanding soil carbon cycling is important for assessing ecosystem response to climate change. Temperate conifer forest soils contain a substantial portion of the global soil C pool and therefore are key components of the global carbon cycle. Despite the importance of temperate forest soil organic carbon (SOC) in the global carbon cycle, the mechanisms and dynamics of SOC accumulation and storage remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled four soils over different bedrock types (rhyolite, granite, basalt, limestone) under Pinus ponderosa to explore the following questions: i) Within a specific ecosystem type, how do SOC contents vary among sites with differing mineralogy? ii) What physicochemical variables are most highly correlated with SOC content, soil microbial community composition and soil respiration? and iii) What mechanisms account for the influence of these variables on SOC cycling? Soil physiochemical and microbiological properties were characterized and compared on the basis of mineral assemblage, pH, organic carbon content, bacterial community composition, respiration rate, microbial biomass, specific metabolic activity (qCO2), and δ13C of respired CO2. The selected field sites spanned a physicochemical gradient, ranging from acid (pH of 5.2) to basic (pH of 7.1) from rhyolite to granite to basalt to limestone. The acidic rhyolite and granite soils had measurable amounts of exchangeable Al3+ (up to 3 cmol+ kg- 1). SOC content varied significantly among sites, ranging from 3.5 to 11 kg C m- 2.in limestone and rhyolite soils, respectively. Soil bacterial communities were also significantly different among all sites. Metal-humus complex and Fe-oxyhydroxide content emerged as important controllers of SOC dynamics across all sites, showing significant correlation with both SOC content (Al-humus: R2 = 0.71; P < 0.01; Fe-humus: R2 = 0.75; P < 0.001; crystalline FeOx: R2 = 0.63; P < 0.01) and bacterial community composition (Al-humus: R2 = 0.35; P < 0.05; Fe-humus: R2 = 0.51; P < 0.01; oxalate-extractable Fe: R2 = 0.59; P < 0.01). Moreover, soil pH was significantly correlated with exchangeable Al3+, metal-humus complex content, bacterial community composition, and microbial biomass C/N ratios. Results indicated that within a specific ecosystem, SOC dynamics and microbial community vary predictably with soil physicochemical variables directly related to mineralogical differences among soil parent materials. Specifically, the data suggest a gradient in the dominant SOC stabilization mechanism among sites, with chemical recalcitrance and metal-humus complexation the dominant control in soils of the acidic rhyolite and granite sites, and mineral adsorption the dominant factor in the basic limestone and basalt sites. Knowledge of parent material dependent SOC dynamics allows for improved estimates of ecosystem SOC stocks and the potential response of SOC to climate change.",

  abstract = {Forest fires contribute a significant amount of CO2 to the atmosphere each year, and CO2 emissions from fires are likely to increase under projected conditions of global climate change. In addition to volatilizing aboveground biomass and litter layers, forest fires have a profound effect on belowground carbon (C) pools and the cycling of soil organic matter as a whole. However, the influence of fire on belowground organic matter cycling is not well defined and varies widely with fire severity. We measured soil organic matter (SOM) characteristics across a range of fire severities two years after the 2002 Biscuit Fire in southwest Oregon, USA, to address the following questions: (1) Which C pools are preferentially volatilized or transformed to charcoal under low-severity and high-severity fire? (2) How does fire change the distribution of SOM among density fractions and depths? (3) How does fire affect the general character of SOM including such variables as abundance, C:N ratio, 13C abundance, and 14C abundance? We examined soils from a mixed hardwood-evergreen forest across a range of burn severities: unburned, low severity, mixed severity, and high severity. Results indicated that increasing burn severity led to progressive loss of forest floor mass, but not to progressive loss of C from the mineral soil. Although fire significantly increased the charcoal content of the soils, fire did not significantly change the distribution of soil organic matter between heavy and free or light fractions. Other significant changes in soil organic matter characteristics included a progressive increase in nitrogen (N) with increasing burn severity, possibly due to the encroachment of N-fixing shrubs following the loss of native vegetation. Although qualitative changes in total root abundance following fire were noted, differences among burn severity treatments were not statistically significant. Increased concentrations of rock fragments in burned areas may be suggestive of erosion in these areas, consistent with previous studies documenting varying degrees of soil erosion following fire. In addition, although 13C abundances were similar among severely burned and unburned plots, soils from severely burned plots were significantly depleted in 14C in comparison to soils from unburned plots. This 14C depletion is most likely the combined result of erosion and preferential combustion of organics enriched in 14C relative to the bulk soil, perhaps reflecting a historical pattern of fire occurrence and severity across the landscape.},

  abstract = {High-latitude terrestrial ecosystems are key components in the global carbon cycle. The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) was developed to quantify stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the northern circumpolar permafrost region (a total area of 18.7 × 106 km2). The NCSCD is a geographical information system (GIS) data set that has been constructed using harmonized regional soil classification maps together with pedon data from the northern permafrost region. Previously, the NCSCD has been used to calculate SOC storage to the reference depths 0–30 cm and 0–100 cm (based on 1778 pedons). It has been shown that soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost region also contain significant quantities of SOC in the 100–300 cm depth range, but there has been no circumpolar compilation of pedon data to quantify this deeper SOC pool and there are no spatially distributed estimates of SOC storage below 100 cm depth in this region. Here we describe the synthesis of an updated pedon data set for SOC storage (kg C m−2) in deep soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost regions, with separate data sets for the 100–200 cm (524 pedons) and 200–300 cm (356 pedons) depth ranges. These pedons have been grouped into the North American and Eurasian sectors and the mean SOC storage for different soil taxa (subdivided into Gelisols including the sub-orders Histels, Turbels, Orthels, permafrost-free Histosols, and permafrost-free mineral soil orders) has been added to the updated NCSCDv2. The updated version of the data set is freely available online in different file formats and spatial resolutions that enable spatially explicit applications in GIS mapping and terrestrial ecosystem models. While this newly compiled data set adds to our knowledge of SOC in the 100–300 cm depth range, it also reveals that large uncertainties remain. Identified data gaps include spatial coverage of deep (> 100 cm) pedons in many regions as well as the spatial extent of areas with thin soils overlying bedrock and the quantity and distribution of massive ground ice. An open access data-portal for the pedon data set and the GIS-data sets is available online at http://bolin.su.se/data/ncscd/. The NCSCDv2 data set has a digital object identifier (doi:10.5879/ECDS/00000002).},

abstract = { I conducted an ecological land survey near Hazen Bay, on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of Alaska during 1994–1998 in order to assess potential effects of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems in this region. Independent classification of three landscape components grouped ecological characteristics of the area into 10 geomorphic units (e.g., tidal flats, abandoned floodplain cover deposits), 9 surface forms (e.g., levees, basins), and 18 plant associations (e.g., Carex rariflora–Salix fuscescens). I then used hierarchical associations among these landscape components to derive an ecosystem classification at three levels of organization that included 10 ecosections (based on geomorphology), 11 ecoseries (based on surface forms and geomorphology), and 27 ecotypes (primarily based on vegetation).The nature and distribution of ecosystems at all levels showed a strong influence from geomorphic processes. The active floodplain, with frequent flooding and sedimentation, had brackish ecotypes that were dominated by graminoids and forbs. The inactive floodplain, where flooding and sedimentation were infrequent, had slightly brackish ecotypes with a wide diversity of species and growth forms. In contrast, the abandoned floodplain, which lacked flooding and sediment deposition, but was strongly affected by permafrost aggradation, had ecotypes that were dominated by evergreen shrubs, mosses, and lichens that were intolerant to salts, but tolerated acidic, nutrient-poor conditions. Ecotypes with similar vegetation generally had similar environmental properties, including surface elevation, soil morphology, sedimentation, organic matter accumulation, thaw depths, water depths, pH, and electrical conductivity. When similar ecotypes were aggregated into ecosections based on geomorphic similarities, differences in ecological properties increased. }

abstract = {The direction and magnitude of soil organic carbon (SOC) changes in response to climate change remain unclear and depend on the spatial distribution of SOC across landscapes. Uncertainties regarding the fate of SOC are greater in high-latitude systems where data are sparse and the soils are affected by sub-zero temperatures. To address these issues in Alaska, a first-order assessment of data gaps and spatial distributions of SOC was conducted from a recently compiled soil carbon database. Temperature and landform type were the dominant controls on SOC distribution for selected ecoregions. Mean SOC pools (to a depth of 1-m) varied by three, seven and ten-fold across ecoregion, landform, and ecosystem types, respectively. Climate interactions with landform type and SOC were greatest in the uplands. For upland SOC there was a six-fold non-linear increase in SOC with latitude (i.e., temperature) where SOC was lowest in the Intermontane Boreal compared to the Arctic Tundra and Coastal Rainforest. Additionally, in upland systems mineral SOC pools decreased as climate became more continental, suggesting that the lower productivity, higher decomposition rates and fire activity, common in continental climates, interacted to reduce mineral SOC. For lowland systems, in contrast, these interactions and their impacts on SOC were muted or absent making SOC in these environments more comparable across latitudes. Thus, the magnitudes of SOC change across temperature gradients were non-uniform and depended on landform type. Additional factors that appeared to be related to SOC distribution within ecoregions included stand age, aspect, and permafrost presence or absence in black spruce stands. Overall, these results indicate the influence of major interactions between temperature-controlled decomposition and topography on SOC in high-latitude systems. However, there remains a need for more SOC data from wetlands and boreal-region permafrost soils, especially at depths>1m in order to fully understand the effects of climate on soil carbon in Alaska.}

  abstract = {To understand how carbon (C) pools in boreal ecosystems may change with warming, we measured above- and belowground C pools and C increment along a soil temperature gradient across 16 mature upland black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. [B·S.P]) forests in interior Alaska. Total spruce C stocks (stand and root C) increased from 1.3 to 8.5 kg C m−2 with increasing soil summed degree-days (SDD > 0°C at 10 cm) across sites, whereas soil C stocks decreased from 11.9 to 6.3 kg C m−2 with increasing SDD. Spruce C and organic soil C, which combined represent maximum C accrual since the last fire, increased with soil heat sums until 600 SDD, and then plateaued with increasing SDD across sites (R 2 = 0.61, P = 0.002; second-order polynomial regression). The sum of soil and total spruce C (total ecosystem C, TEC) reached its maximum in the middle-range of soil temperatures measured (approximately 600 SDD), and was lower in the coolest (139 SDD) and the warmest (914 SDD) forests. The opposing trends between above- and belowground pools resulted in C shifting from the soil to spruce biomass with warmer soil temperatures. A shift in C distribution from below- to aboveground pools, as temperature increases, has implications for the vulnerability of C lost in boreal forest wildfires. The strongly negative relationship between surface mineral soil C stocks and increasing temperatures warrants further research into the potential loss of deep mineral soil C stocks with continued warming, especially in forests presently underlain with permafrost.},

abstract = {Boreal ecosystems contain a substantial fraction of the earth's soil carbon stores and are prone to frequent and severe wildfires. In this study, we examine changes in element and organic matter stocks due to a 1999 wildfire in Alaska. One year after the wildfire, burned soils contained between 1071 and 1420 g/m2 less carbon than unburned soils. Burned soils had lower nitrogen than unburned soils, higher calcium, and nearly unchanged potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus stocks. Burned surface soils tended to have higher concentrations of noncombustible elements such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus compared with unburned soils. Combustion losses of carbon were mostly limited to surface dead moss and fibric horizons, with no change in the underlying mineral horizons. Burning caused significant changes in soil organic matter structure, with a 12% higher ratio of carbon to combustible organic matter in surface burned horizons compared with unburned horizons. Pyrolysis gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy also shows preferential volatilization of polysaccharide-derived organic matter and enrichment of lignin- and lipid-derived compounds in surface soils. The chemistry of deeper soil layers in burned and unburned sites was similar, suggesting that immediate fire impacts were restricted to the surface soil horizon.}

abstract = {High‐latitude regions store large amounts of organic carbon (OC) in active‐layer soils and permafrost, accounting for nearly half of the global belowground OC pool. In the boreal region, recent warming has promoted changes in the fire regime, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and alter soil OC dynamics in both organic and mineral soil. We examined how interactions between fire and permafrost govern rates of soil OC accumulation in organic horizons, mineral soil of the active layer, and near‐surface permafrost in a black spruce ecosystem of interior Alaska. To estimate OC accumulation rates, we used chronosequence, radiocarbon, and modeling approaches. We also developed a simple model to track long‐term changes in soil OC stocks over past fire cycles and to evaluate the response of OC stocks to future changes in the fire regime. Our chronosequence and radiocarbon data indicate that OC turnover varies with soil depth, with fastest turnover occurring in shallow organic horizons (∼60 years) and slowest turnover in near‐surface permafrost (>3000 years). Modeling analysis indicates that OC accumulation in organic horizons was strongly governed by carbon losses via combustion and burial of charred remains in deep organic horizons. OC accumulation in mineral soil was influenced by active layer depth, which determined the proportion of mineral OC in a thawed or frozen state and thus, determined loss rates via decomposition. Our model results suggest that future changes in fire regime will result in substantial reductions in OC stocks, largely from the deep organic horizon. Additional OC losses will result from fire‐induced thawing of near‐surface permafrost. From these findings, we conclude that the vulnerability of deep OC stocks to future warming is closely linked to the sensitivity of permafrost to wildfire disturbance.},

  abstract = {The topography, geology, hydrology, vegetation, and wildlife of the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) provide a complex and intricate array of resources that directly impact land stewardship and use decisions (Fig. 1). The purpose of this document is to consolidate general information regarding the natural resources and physical characteristics of the ORR. The ORR, encompassing 33,114 acres (13,401 ha) of federally owned land and three Department of Energy (DOE) installations, is located in Roane and Anderson Counties in east Tennessee, mostly within the corporate limits of the city of Oak Ridge and southwest of the population center of Oak Ridge. The ORR is bordered on the north and east by the population center of the city of Oak Ridge and on the south and west by the Clinch River/Melton Hill Lake impoundment. All areas of the ORR are relatively pristine when compared with the surrounding region, especially in the Valley and Ridge Physiographic Province (Fig. 2). From the air, the ORR is clearly a large and nearly continuous island of forest within a landscape that is fragmented by urban development and agriculture. Satellite imagery from 2006 was used to develop a land-use/land-cover cover map of the ORR and surrounding lands (Fig. 3). Following the acquisition of the land comprising the ORR in the early 1940s, much of the Reservation served as a buffer for the three primary facilities: the X-10 nuclear research facility (now known as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory [ORNL]), the first uranium enrichment facility or Y-12 (now known as the Y-12 National Security Complex [Y-12 Complex]), and a gaseous diffusion enrichment facility (now known as the East Tennessee Technology Park [ETTP]). Over the past 60 years, this relatively undisturbed area has evolved into a rich and diverse eastern deciduous forest ecosystem of streams and reservoirs, hardwood forests, and extensive upland mixed forests. The combination of a large land area with complex physical characteristics and diverse natural resources has provided a critical foundation for supporting DOE's environmental research mission, as well as the area in which to build leading-edge facilities.}

  abstract = {This paper is the first to provide chemical, physical, and morphological properties of the soils in the boreal region of Alaska and to demonstrate the dominant effect of landscape attributes in soil formation. This study was conducted to characterize soils and landscape relationships in the boreal forest of Alaska. Sites representing major landform positions and vegetation communities were selected for study. Well‐drained, shallow to moderately deep Inceptisols occur on the drier and warmer south aspect slopes with thin (5–9 cm) organic horizons and loamy textures. Poorly drained Gelisols form on wet and cold north aspect slopes and valley floors with thick (18–52 cm) organic horizons and permafrost within 45 to 60 cm of the surface. On the latter, mineral horizons are reduced. Soils on the ridgetop show features of relic, nonsorted circle (a type of pattern grounds) that indicate a previous periglacial environment. The mineral soil on backslopes is shallow to moderately deep due to gelifluction and slope movement but deep toward toeslopes. Charcoal particles, commonly found within the soil profiles, attest to frequent fire events in the past. Fire has the greatest impact on soil properties on south aspect slopes because the organic horizons are thin and dry, and easily destroyed by fire. The underlying mineral horizons often develop hydrophobicity resulted from moderately and severe burn. Slope, aspect, and slope gradient are major controlling factors for the contrasting soil types along the catena sequences in the watershed.},

  title = {Plant Species Composition and Productivity following Permafrost Thaw and Thermokarst in Alaskan Tundra},
  journal = {Ecosystems},
  absract = {Climate warming is expected to have a large impact on plant species composition and productivity in northern latitude ecosystems. Warming can affect vegetation communities directly through temperature effects on plant growth and indirectly through alteration of soil nutrient availability. In addition, warming can cause permafrost to thaw and thermokarst (ground subsidence) to develop, which can alter the structure of the ecosystem by altering hydrological patterns within a site. These multiple direct and indirect effects of permafrost thawing are difficult to simulate in experimental approaches that often manipulate only one or two factors. Here, we used a natural gradient approach with three sites to represent stages in the process of permafrost thawing and thermokarst. We found that vascular plant biomass shifted from graminoid-dominated tundra in the least disturbed site to shrub-dominated tundra at the oldest, most subsided site, whereas the intermediate site was co-dominated by both plant functional groups. Vascular plant productivity patterns followed the changes in biomass, whereas nonvascular moss productivity was especially important in the oldest, most subsided site. The coefficient of variation for soil moisture was higher in the oldest, most subsided site suggesting that in addition to more wet microsites, there were other microsites that were drier. Across all sites, graminoids preferred the cold, dry microsites whereas the moss and shrubs were associated with the warm, moist microsites. Total nitrogen contained in green plant biomass differed across sites, suggesting that there were increases in soil nitrogen availability where permafrost had thawed.}

  title = {Carbon allocation in boreal black spruce forests across regions varying in soil temperature and precipitation},
  abstract = {A common hypothesis for northern ecosystems is that low soil temperatures inhibit plant productivity. To address this hypothesis, we reviewed how separate components of ecosystem carbon (C) cycling varied along a soil temperature gradient for nine well‐drained, relatively productive boreal black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. [B.S.P.]) forests in Alaska, USA, and Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. Annual soil temperature [expressed as soil summed degree days (SDD)] was positively correlated with aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), while negatively correlated with total belowground carbon flux (TBCF). The partitioning of C to ANPP at the expense of root processes represented a nearly 1 : 1 tradeoff across the soil temperature gradient, which implied that the amount of C cycling through these black spruce ecosystems was relatively insensitive to variation in SDD. Moreover, the rate at which C accumulated in the ecosystem since the last stand replacing fire was unrelated to SDD, but SDD was positively correlated to the ratio of spruce‐biomass : forest‐floor‐mass. Thus, plant partitioning of C and the distribution of ecosystem C were apparently affected by soil temperature, although across regions, precipitation co‐varied with soil temperature. These two factors likely correlated with one another because of precipitation's influence on soil heat balance, suggesting that a soil temperature–precipitation interaction could be responsible for the shifts in C allocation. Nonetheless, our results highlight that for this boreal ecosystem, ANPP and TBCF can be negatively correlated. In tropical and temperate forests, TBCF and ANPP have been reported as positively correlated, and our results may reflect the unique interactions between soil temperature, forest floor accumulation, rooting depth, and nutrient availability that characterize the black spruce forest type.},
